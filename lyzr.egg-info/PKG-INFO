        ## Installation
        
        You can install the `lyzr` package directly from PyPI:
        
        ```console
        pip install lyzr
        ```
        
        ## Building from Source
        
        If you prefer to build the `lyzr` package from source, you'll need to have Python installed along with `setuptools` and `wheel`. 
        
        ### Steps to Build:
        
        1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
        2. Navigate to the root directory of the project (where `setup.py` is located).
        3. Run the following commands:
        
        ```console
        # Ensure setuptools and wheel are installed
        pip install setuptools wheel
        
        # Build the package
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        This will generate a `dist` directory containing the built package files.
        
        ### Installing the Built Package:
        
        Once you've built the package, you can install it using pip:
        
        ```console
        cd dist/
        pip install lyzr-[version]-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        Replace `[version]` with the actual version of the package you have built.
